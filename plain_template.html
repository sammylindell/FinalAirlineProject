<p>During the winter holiday season, travelers are faced with the fear that visiting family for Kwanza, Hanukkah, or Christmas will be delayed, even canceled, due to a snowstorm passing through or long security wait times. </p>

<p> According to the Bureau of Transportation, United States airlines carried around 674 million passengers total in 2021. In a pandemic setting, these airlines had to adapt to masking and vaccination policies to ensure the safety of these passengers.</p>

<p> AJ Sidhu is an airline booker who says the main reasons why he books flights are based on price, elite status, cancelation policies, timing, alternative airports in the area, and connecting airport weather factors. According to Sidhu, travel, especially international travel, has impacted planning over the pandemic. </p>

<p>Airports see some of the most traffic of the year during the winter holiday season. With travel uncertainty in the northern part of the United States during the winter months, the Federal Aviation Administration estimates that nearly 70% of flight delays are due to weather. This can lead to missed connections and holidays. </p>

<p> According to ABC10, some of the busiest travel days of the year are the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, December 23, and Monday, January 3. These are all prominent dates, however, a delay or cancellation on December 23 can cause issues on December 24, Christmas Eve, and even running into Christmas Day.</p>

<p> AJ Sidhu says that he spends a lot of time booking flights to Miami. Currently, Florida is facing an airline crisis. Sidhu says that this is because there is a lack of staff in general at airlines nationwide, but there has been so much air traffic in the state of Florida. Sidhu says that he will track flights to see if they are going to come in on time, and will sometimes switch flights last-minute if he knows there will be a delay. </p>

<p>To combat this problem, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is planning to hire more air traffic controllers as well as collaborate with airlines to avoid the cancellations of future flights in Florida. Looking ahead to the future, if this traffic is still high in the winter holiday season, there will be an increase in cancellations and issues. </p>

<p>According to a recent article from “The Guardian,” U.S. airlines are still rebounding from staffing shortages after the pandemic shutdown. Airline workers have reported sleeping on the airport floors while their employers could not find hotel rooms. A flight attendant at JetBlue says that sometimes she feels the workers are treated as “hostages,” unable to get out of work. The rigorous lifestyle that comes with working in the airline industry, especially for flight attendants and pilots, creates a harder work-life balance. She says it is especially hard for those with families. </p>

<p> The factors that contribute to airplane delays cause staff to be overworked due to the shortage of workers. Transitioning from a pre-pandemic setting to a pandemic setting, now to a post-pandemic setting is making airline travel impossible. This year is predicted to be worse than those previous due to an increase in flyers and a decrease in staffing. </p>

<p>According to JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, and Frontier Airlines, staffing issues have been extremely prominent lately and are at fault for the recent delays and cancellations of flights. Just last month, thousands of flights were canceled. </p>

<p> Spirit Airlines has had staffing issues since August 2021, resulting in four operation meltdowns ever since. According to the Association of Flight Attendants - Communications Workers of America, this is not common. Because of this, Spirit Airlines workers have protested outside airports across multiple cities. </p>

<p> The United States government has stated that they will provide airlines with more information about airspace, travel plans, and trends to combat these airspace closures. The FAA also plans to update its surveillance to prevent this problem in the long run. </p>

<p> Airline travel, cancellations, and delays cause unnecessary stress, especially during the holidays. With the issue at hand in Florida, the predicted increase in airline travel “coming out of the pandemic,” these preventative measures will hopefully keep the flow of airplane traffic going. </p>

<p> In Johannesburg, there was a fuel shortage issue, where flights had to be grounded and canceled due to the lack of resources. Flying internationally in this day and age is even more difficult for pandemic-related reasons and non-pandemic factors. The war between Russia and Ukraine has hindered any travel over the countries. This is something that needs to be taken into account even when flying internationally this holiday season. </p>

<p>Many elements contribute to the failure and downfall of certain airports, cities, and airlines. There are many reasons why travelers should avoid different certain places when flying. With the predicted increase in travel this winter, it is important to look at the various factors in which travel can be obstructed.</p>
